"I understand that JavaScript is single-threaded but event-driven, and I use async/await and Promises effectively to write non-blocking, readable code."

"I'm comfortable explaining how closures, hoisting, and the event loop work â€” and I actively use them to write clean, modular code."

"JavaScript's flexibility is powerful â€” Iâ€™ve used it to build everything from backend APIs with Node.js to interactive frontends with React."

"I can debug asynchronous issues using the call stack, microtask queue, and event loop behavior â€” not just console logs."

"I treat JavaScript not just as a scripting language but as a robust foundation for scalable architecture when used with discipline."
